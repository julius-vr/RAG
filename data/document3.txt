Designing Urban Green Spaces for Sustainable Cities
----------------------------------------------------
As cities continue to grow, urban green spaces are becoming critical to enhancing quality of life and promoting environmental sustainability. Well-designed parks, green roofs, and community gardens not only provide recreational areas but also contribute to improved air quality and reduced urban heat island effects. Urban planners are increasingly incorporating nature-based solutions into city design, ensuring that residents have access to nature within densely populated areas. These initiatives also foster community engagement and support mental health by offering serene environments amidst urban bustle.
